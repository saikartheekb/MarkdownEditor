<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Welcome to the first stage of the project! </p>

<p>If you have worked with the markdown, you will probably recognize the following syntax:</p>

<pre>	<code class="language-markdown"># The Beatles
One may say that they were the most famous **rock band** ever.
The legendary **line-up** comprised the following people:
* *John Lennon*
* *Paul McCartney*
* *George Harrison*
* *Ringo Starr*</code>
</pre>

<p>Yes! It is a raw markdown code. It translates into:</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>Determine and print the source (raw) markdown code of the markdown snippet below. Show your understanding of the syntax basics. You can use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the Markdown Guide</a> as it covers all the necessary topics.</p>

<p>Below is the snippet to complete this stage. Once you write it in the markdown syntax, put it into triple quotes and print it:</p>
